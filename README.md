**`icon.gl` is an inspired icon library based on the traditional Kaidā glyphs used historically in the Yaeyama Islands of Japan. These glyphs, rooted in local administration and communication, encompass a variety of symbols representing animals, plants, numerals, and household items.**

## Introduction

Icon.gl is a modern, innovative icon library infused with the essence of traditional [Kaidā glyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaid%C4%81_glyphs), echoing the historical charm of the Yaeyama Islands. Our design principles revolve around simplicity, modernity, and a touch of quirkiness. Each icon is distilled to its fundamental form, ensuring it embodies only the most essential characteristics. With bold geometric shapes, our icons boast a symmetrical and consistent look, providing unparalleled clarity and readability even at smaller sizes. This unique blend of contemporary design and cultural heritage makes icon.gl not just a collection of symbols, but a storytelling tool that bridges the past with the present.

## Usage

Iconography is highly functional in a user interface. When used wisely, icons become an elegant yet efficient way to communicate with and help guide a user through an experience. To maintain this functionality, it’s important to reduce cognitive load on users by employing icons sparingly and strategically throughout your designs.
