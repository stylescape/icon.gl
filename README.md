**`icon.gl` is an inspired icon library based on the traditional Kaidā glyphs used historically in the Yaeyama Islands of Japan. These glyphs, rooted in local administration and communication, encompass a variety of symbols representing animals, plants, numerals, and household items.**

## Introduction

Icon.gl is a modern, innovative icon library infused with the essence of traditional [Kaidā glyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaid%C4%81_glyphs), echoing the historical charm of the Yaeyama Islands. Our design principles revolve around simplicity, modernity, and a touch of quirkiness. Each icon is distilled to its fundamental form, ensuring it embodies only the most essential characteristics. With bold geometric shapes, our icons boast a symmetrical and consistent look, providing unparalleled clarity and readability even at smaller sizes. This unique blend of contemporary design and cultural heritage makes icon.gl not just a collection of symbols, but a storytelling tool that bridges the past with the present.

## Design principles

### Concept

`icon.gl` icons are designed to be simple, modern, friendly, and sometimes quirky. Each icon is reduced to its minimal form, expressing essential characteristics.

## Features

- Diverse Range
Includes icons representing a broad spectrum of elements from nature, agriculture, and domestic life.
- Integrates with Kyū (*q*) hybrid measurement unit used by the [`unit.gl`](https://unit.gl/) Layout Engine.
- Balanced

<!-- - Cultural Heritage: Reflects the rich historical context of the Yaeyama Islands.
- Numerical Symbols: Incorporates unique numeral systems, influenced by Suzhou numerals. -->

## Usage

Ideal for projects seeking a blend of historical and cultural aesthetics with functional iconography.

Iconography is highly functional in a user interface. When used wisely, icons become an elegant yet efficient way to communicate with and help guide a user through an experience. To maintain this functionality, it’s important to reduce cognitive load on users by employing icons sparingly and strategically throughout your designs.
